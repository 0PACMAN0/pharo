# How to contribute

## Reporting issues
If you found a bug or issue with Pharo please let us know. You can report bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/issues).

### How to report a bug
*  Take the latest stable or latest development system, ideally using the latest virtual machine is better (check [download](https://pharo.org/download) page).
*  Make sure that you can reproduce the bug.
*  Send a mail to the mailing-list pharo-dev mailing if you are not sure.
*  Open a bug entry on https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/issues. But before check if the bug was already reported!
*  Do not forget to mention the virtual machine version, your OS and other crucial information
*  Follow your bug. It may happen that your bug is fixed by introducing another bug fix and you can verify and close it.

### How to propose a bug fix or enhancement
* First, sign the [license agreement](http://files.pharo.org/media/PharoSoftwareDistributionAgreement.pdf).

See the wiki page: *https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/wiki/Contribute-a-fix-to-Pharo*

#### CI checking your submission

The fix then will be checked by an automated tool (the CI). After it passes this test, humans come again into the picture: your code needs to be reviewed, if possible by 2-3 people. If they accept it, it will be merged.
