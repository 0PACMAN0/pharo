For example:"AbstractTutorial subclass: #HowToDebug	instanceVariableNames: ''	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'YourTutorial'.	ProfStef next.#### Lesson factory methods"Next, create category 'lessons' and add a method per lesson.Each method must return a Lesson object.Your can use Lesson class>>title:lesson: to create Lesson object."HowToDebug compile:'useSelfHalt	^ Lessontitle: ''self halt''lesson: ''"Put self halt. in the method you want to debug."ProfStef next.'''classified: 'lessons'.HowToDebug compile:'examineStackTrace	^ Lessontitle: ''self halt''lesson: ''"Look at PharoDebug.log."ProfStef next.'''classified: 'lessons'.HowToDebug compile:'changeReturnValue	^ Lessontitle: ''Change return value''lesson: ''"Easy in the debugger !"'''classified: 'lessons'.ProfStef next.#### Implement tutorial method"Finally implement the tutorial method to return an Array of your lesson factory methods:"HowToDebug compile:'tutorial	^ #( #useSelfHalt #examineStackTrace #changeReturnValue)'classified: 'tutorial'.ProfStef next.#### Run your tutorial"You can run your fresh new tutorial like this:" ProfStef goOn: HowToDebug.### Pharo Syntax Tutorial#### Welcome"Hello! I'm Professor Stef.You must want me to help you learn Pharo.So let's go to the first lesson. Select the text below, right-click and choose 'Do it'"ProfStef next.#### Doing"Cool! (I like to say Cooool :) ). You've just executed a Pharo expression. More precisely, you sent the message 'next' to ProfStef class (it's me!).Note you can run this tutorial again by evaluating: 'ProfStef go'. 'ProfStef previous' returns to the previous lesson.You can also Do it using the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl + D' (or 'Cmd + D' on MacOS). Try to evaluate these expressions:"StPlayground open.SmalltalkImage current aboutThisSystem."Then go to the next lesson:"ProfStef next.#### Printing"Now you're a Do it master! Let's talk about printing. It's a Do it which prints the result next to the expression you've selected.For example, select the text below, open the menu and click on 'Print it':"1 + 2."You've seen the keyboard keys next to the 'Print it'? It indicates the Ctrl- (or Cmd-) shortcut to execute this command.Try 'Ctrl + P' (or 'Cmd + P') on the following expressions:"Date today.Time now."The result is selected, so you can erase it using the backspace key. Try it!"SmalltalkImage current datedVersion.ProfStef next.#### Inspecting"Now you're a Do it and Print it master! Let's talk about inspecting. It's a Do it which opens an Inspector on the result of evaluating the expression you've selected. The Inspector is a tool that allows you to have a look inside an object.For example, select the text below, open the menu and click on 'Inspect it':"1 / 2."You've seen the keyboard keys next to the 'Inspect it'? It indicates the Ctrl- (or Cmd-) shortcut to execute this command.Try 'Ctrl + I' (or 'Cmd + I') on the following expressions:"DateAndTime today.Float pi.SystemVersion current.ProfStef next.#### Basic types: Numbers"You now know how to execute Pharo code. Now let's talk about basic objects.1, 2, 100, 2/3 ... are Numbers, and respond to many messages evaluating mathematical expressions.Evaluate these ones:"2.20 factorial.1000 factorial / 999 factorial.(1/3).(1/3) + (4/5).(1/3) asFloat.1 class.1 class maxVal class.(1 class maxVal + 1) class.ProfStef next.#### Basic types: Characters"A Character can be instantiated using $ operator:"$A.$A class.$B charCode.Character cr.Character space."You can print all 256 characters of the ASCII extended set:"Character allByteCharacters.ProfStef next.#### Basic types: Strings"A String is a collection of characters. Use single quotes to create a String object. Print these expressions:"'ProfStef'.'ProfStef' size.'abc' asUppercase.'Hello World' reverse. "You can access each character using at: message"'ProfStef' at: 1."String concatenation uses the comma operator:"'ProfStef', ' is cool'.ProfStef next.#### Basic types: Symbols"A Symbol is a String which is guaranteed to be globally unique. There is one and only one Symbol #ProfStef. There may be several 'ProfStef' String objects.(Message == returns true if the two objects are the SAME)"'ProfStef' asSymbol. #ProfStef asString.(2 asString) == (2 asString).(2 asString) asSymbol == (2 asString) asSymbol.(Smalltalk globals at: #ProfStef) next.#### Basic types: Array"Literal arrays are created at parse time and are read-only:" #(1 2 3). #(1 2 3 #(4 5 6)) size. #(1 2 4) isEmpty. #(1 2 3) first. #('hello' 'World') at: 2."You can modify a copy" #('hello' 'World') copy at: 2 put: 'Pharo'; yourself.ProfStef next.#### Basic types: Dynamic Array"Dynamic Arrays are created at execution time:"{ (2+3) . (6*6) }.{ (2+3) . (6*6) . 'hello', ' Stef'} size.{ ProfStef } first next.#### Message syntax: Unary messages"Messages are sent to objects. There are three types of message: unary, binary and keyword.Unary messages have the following form:    anObject aMessage You've already sent unary messages. For example:"1 class.false not.Time now.Date today.Float pi."And of course:"ProfStef next.#### Message syntax: Binary messages"Binary messages have the following form:    anObject + anotherObject"3 * 2.Date today + 3 weeks.false | false.true & true.true & false.10 @ 100.10 <= 12.'ab', 'cd'.Date today < Date yesterday.ProfStef next.#### Message syntax: Keyword messages"Keyword messages are messages with arguments. They have the following form:    anObject akey: anotherObject akey2: anotherObject2"4 between: 0 and: 10."The message is between:and: sent to the Number 4"1 max: 3.Color r:1 g:0 b:0."The message is r:g:b: implemented on class Color. Note you can also write"Color	r:1	g:1	b:0.	ProfStef perform: #next.#### Message syntax: Execution order"Unary messages are executed first, then binary messages and finally keyword messages:    Unary > Binary > Keywords"2 + 3 squared.2 raisedTo: 3 + 2.  (0@0) class.0@0 corner: 100@200.(0@0 corner: 100@200) class."Between messages of similar precedence, expressions are executed from left to right"-3 abs negated reciprocal.ProfStef next.#### Message syntax: Parentheses"Use parentheses to change order of evaluation"(2 + 3) squared.(2 raisedTo: 3) + 2.(0@0 extent: 100@200) bottomRight.ProfStef next.#### Mathematical precedence"Traditional precedence rules from mathematics do not apply in Pharo."2 * 10 + 2."Here the message * is sent to 2, which answers 20, then 20 receive the message +Remember that all messages always follow a simple left-to-right precedence rule, * without exceptions *."2 + 2 * 10.2 + (2 * 10).8 - 5 / 2.(8 - 5) / 2.8 - (5 / 2).ProfStef next.#### Message syntax: Cascade"; is the cascade operator. It's useful to send message to the SAME receiver.Open a Transcript (console):"Transcript open."Then:"Transcript show: 'hello'.Transcript show: 'Pharo'.Transcript cr."is equivalent to:"Transcript 	   show: 'hello';	   show: 'Pharo' ;	   cr."Try to go to the next lesson with a cascade of two 'next' messages:"ProfStef#### Lost?"Hey, you should not be here!! Go back and use a cascade!"ProfStef previous.#### Blocks"Cascade is cool! Let's talk about blocks.Blocks are anonymous methods that can be stored into variables and executed on demand.Blocks are delimited by square brackets: []"[StPlayground open]."does not open a Browser because the block is not executed.Here is a block that adds 2 to its argument (its argument is named x):"[:x | x+2]."We can execute a block by sending it value messages."[:x | x+2] value: 5.[StPlayground open] value.[:x | x+2] value: 10.[:x :y| x + y] value:3 value:5.[ProfStef next] value.#### Block assignation"Blocks can be assigned to a variable then executed later.Note that |b| is the declaration of a variable named 'b' and that ':=' assigns a value to a variable.Select the three lines then Print it:"|b|b := [:x | x+2].b value: 12.ProfStef next.#### Conditionals"Conditionals are just messages sent to Boolean objects"1 < 2  ifTrue: [100]  ifFalse: [42]."Here the message is ifTrue:ifFalse:Try this:"Transcript open.3 > 10 	ifTrue: [Transcript show: 'Maybe there''s a bug ....']	ifFalse: [Transcript show: 'No: 3 is less than 10'].3 = 3 ifTrue: [ProfStef next].#### Loops"Loops are high-level collection iterators, implemented as regular methods.""Basic loops:  to:do:  to:by:do:"1 to: 100 do: [:i | Transcript show: i asString; cr].1 to: 100 by: 3 do: [:i | Transcript show: i asString; cr].100 to: 0 by: -2 do: [:i | Transcript show: i asString; cr].1 to: 1 do: [:i | ProfStef next].#### Iterators"The message do: is sent to a collection of objects (Array, Set, OrderedCollection), evaluating the block for each element.Here we want to print all the numbers on the Transcript (a console)" #(11 38 3 -2 10) do: [:each |     Transcript show: each printString; cr]."Some other really nice iterators" #(11 38 3 -2 10) collect: [:each | each abs]. #(11 38 3 -2 10) collect: [:each | each odd]. #(11 38 3 -2 10) select: [:each | each odd]. #(11 38 3 -2 10) select: [:each | each > 10]. #(11 38 3 -2 10) reject: [:each | each > 10]. #(11 38 3 -2 10)      do: [:each | Transcript show: each printString]     separatedBy: [Transcript show: '.'].ProfStef allInstances do: [:aPharoTutorial | aPharoTutorial next].#### Instantiation"Objects are instances of their class. Usually, we send the message #new to a class for creating an instance of this class.The message #allInstances sent to a class answers an Array with all instances of this class.For example, let's look at how many instances of SimpleButtonMorph exist. Please use only Do it or Print it on this page, not Inspect it."SimpleButtonMorph allInstances size."Now create a new instance of it:"SimpleButtonMorph new	label: 'A nice button';	openCenteredInWorld."See the button centered on the world? The list of all instances should contains one more instance:"SimpleButtonMorph allInstances size."Let's play with it:"SimpleButtonMorph allInstances last 	label: 'ProfStef is cooooool !';	color: Color cyan.	"Let's delete it and ask the system to clean the memory:"SimpleButtonMorph allInstances last delete.Smalltalk garbageCollect.SimpleButtonMorph allInstances size."Click on the button to go to next lesson:"SimpleButtonMorph new	label: 'Go to next lesson';	target: [ProfStef next. 			   SimpleButtonMorph allInstances last delete];	actionSelector: #value;	openCenteredInWorld.#### Reflection"You can inspect and change the system at runtime.Take a look at method #ifFalse:ifTrue: source code of class True:"(True>>#ifFalse:ifTrue:) sourceCode."Or just its comment:"(True>>#ifFalse:ifTrue:) comment."Here's all the methods I implement:"ProfStef selectors."Now let's create a new method to go to the next lesson:"ProfStef class compile:'goToNextLesson  self next'."Wow! I can't wait to use my new method!"ProfStef goToNextLesson.#### Reflection continued"So cool, isn't it? Before going further, let's remove this method:"ProfStef respondsTo: #goToNextLesson.ProfStef class removeSelector: #goToNextLesson.ProfStef respondsTo: #goToNextLesson."Then move forward:"ProfStef default executeMethod: (ProfStef lookupSelector:#next).#### Pharo environment"Pharo is full of objects. There are windows, text, numbers, dates, colors, points and much more. You can interact with objects in a much more direct way than is possible with other programming languages.Every object understands the message 'inspect'. As a result, you get an Inspector window that shows details about the object."Date today inspect."This shows that the date object consists of a point in time (start) and a duration (one day long)."ProfStef inspect."You see, ProfStef class has a lot of objects. Let's take a look at my code:"ProfStef browse.ProfStef next.#### Debugger"The Debugger may be the most famous tool of Smalltalk environments. It will open as soon as an unmanaged Exception occurs. The following code will open the debugger on the message stack, select PharoSyntaxTutorial>>divideTwoByZero".PharoSyntaxTutorial new divideTwoByZero.#### Tutorial done!"This tutorial is done.
