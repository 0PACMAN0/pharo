#Â Debug Points

The debug point system is a model destined to replace the former breakpoint and watchpoint model.

## Types of debug points

**Debug points** are different types of **instrumentation that are used to debug**. 
For now, there are two concrete types of debug points: **breakpoints and watchpoints**.

As commonly known, breakpoints halts the program and watchpoints saves a value in its history when they are hit.
Basic debug points can also be used but they do nothing unless we add **behaviors** to them.

## Debug Point Targets

Debug points can be installed on different types of targets:

- an *AST node*, which can be targeted by selecting source code in the Calypso browser. In this case, the debug point is reached when the corresponding code is executed.
  API: 
- a *variable*, which can be targeted by selecting a variable in the variable view in the Calypso browser. In this case, the debug point is reached each time the targeted variable is read or/and written 
- an *object*, in order to install object-centric debug points. This type of target wraps another target (AST or variable). In this case, the debug point is reached only if the wrapped target is reached and if the receiver is the target instance.

## Behaviors of debug points

A debug point can have **different types of behaviors** that will execute before the debug point is actually hit.

Among these behaviors, there are:

- *Once* behavior: the debug point becomes disabled after it is hit
- *Count* behavior: counts the number of times the debug point has been hit
- *Condition* behavior: sets a condition that must evaluate to `true` so that the debug point can actually be hit
- *Chain Link* behavior: combines debug points into a chain. In that case, when a debug point is hit in the chain, it disables itself and enables the next debug point in the chain. In other words, each debug points in the chain is hit only once in a specific order
- *Script* behavior: executes a script each time the debug point is hit
- *Transcript* behavior: logs a string to the Transcript each time the debug point is hit

All these behaviors can be set when creating a breakpoint from the Calypso browser in the method editor.

To have more flexibility to configure existing debug points or to create different types of debug points, it is possible to use an API on `DebugPoint` objects or via the `DebugPointManager`.

It will be possible to configure debug points via a UI tool, the Debug Point Browser, which will be the object of another PR in NewTools
