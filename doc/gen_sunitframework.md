# SUnit framework## IntroductionSUnit is the mother of all unit testing frameworks, and serves as one of the cornerstones of test-driven development methodologies such as eXtreme Programming. The culture of testing has always been part of the philosophy of development in Smalltalk:You write a method, accept the code and test it by writing a small script in a workspace, in a comment or an example as a class method. But this approach does not allow to automatically repeat the testing or ensure that the code is working. SUnit is a framework you can use to describe and execute unit tests. Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application.## Running testsSUnit allows writing tests on Smalltalk source code and checking results. This is usually done in a tool called TestRunner which you can either open from the Pharo world menu or by evaluating:   TestRunner openin a Smalltalk workspace.By writing tests and checking them with the test runner you can ensure the sustainability of your applications.## Tutorial### Step 1 - Define a test classTo define a series of tests in SUnit one typically creates a subclass of class TestCase. The idea is that the methods of this class will implement several tests, the instance variables represent the objects and / or the context in which these tests will be performed. In our example we want to write a test on a simple Person class (which is not yet in our image). If the unit under test is a single class one convention is to name the test like the class but followed with the postfix "Test". So to create a test for the Person class we subclass TestCase with a custom "PersonTest" class.	TestCase subclass: #PersonTest		instanceVariableNames: ''		classVariableNames: ''		poolDictionaries: ''		category: 'MyApp-Tests-Model'Note that we have not created the class Person yet - so one idea of ExtremeProgramming (XP) is to write the test first as a way to describe a use case that your application has to cover. After that you write the code and the test will show you if the scenario is fulfilled. You dont have to follow this programming style and can also write tests to cover existing code.	### Step 2 - Define a first test methodTo define a test we create a new instance side method for our first test scenario. By convention any method (in a subclass of TestCase) whose selector starts with 'test' is supposed to be a test and can be run using the TestRunner tool:	testInstanceCreation		|person|		person := Person named: 'Beck'.		person firstName: 'Kent'.		self assert: person fullName = 'Kent Beck'.		A good style is to put this method into the method category 'testing'.When you accept the code the system may ask you about the new class Person. It's not yet defined - but you can easily create it using the following class definition:	Object subclass: #Person		instanceVariableNames: 'name firstName' 		classVariableNames: ''		poolDictionaries: ''		category: 'MyApp-Core-Model'### Step 3 - Running our first test methodTo run our test case method we can evaluate the following code snippet in a workspace:	PersonTest run: #testInstanceCreationIf you print the result then the following will appear:      1 run, 0 passes, 0 skipped, 0 expected failures, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 unexpected passesThis tells us that one test has been run and one error occurred while testing. Currently we dont have all messages implemented - so the test has to fail. If you want to debug the test to see what has happened you can evaluate:     PersonTest debug: #testInstanceCreation 	### Step 4 - Using the TestRunnerTesting by evaluating an expression as we is not very convenient - so it is better to open the TestRunner - a user interface tool displaying all the tests in the system. You can start it either using the world menu or by evaluating     TestRunner openin a workspace.Scroll down until you find the class category 'MyApp-Tests-Model' and select the test by clicking on the class PersonTest. It is possible to select more than one test/category. Now click on "Run selected". If you run the test in the test runner it will be marked red since it contains errors. The test runner will also show you the result of the test run:     1 run, 0 passes, 0 skipped, 0 expected failures, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 unexpected passesIf you click on the failed method in the lower right pane the debugger will open.### Step 5 - Getting the test greenTo get our test green we have to implement the missing methods. First the debugger tells us that the Person class does not understand the message #named: We dont have to go back into a standard browser to implement it, we just select 'Create' in the walkback window. The system now asks us where #named: should be defined in the inheritance hierarchy. We select the Person class and categorize the method in a new method category 'instance creation'.Finally we have a debugger open where we can implement the code like this:  named: aString 	^(self new)		name: aString;		yourself		Note that after accepting the method in the debugger you can instantly step through it or hit 'Proceed' to continue execution. The system tell us that there is no setter method #name:, so we implement it too on the instance side:	   name: aString	name := aStringNext the #firstName: message is missing:	   firstName: aString	firstName := aString	At any point in time we can control if the test is already green in the TestRunner. Finally when we implementthe missing #fullName method by concatenating first name and surename:	fullName		^firstName, ' ', name  		Now out test should be green.## API Documentation###

processing envolves many message sends and it increases the chances for the process to be preempted.	Therefore a single iteration is not always enough to get the expected corner case. 	Thus the function under the test is repeated in the loopProcessMonitorTestServiceTest>>#testFailTestWhenItIsCompletedWithBackgroundFailuresMethod has no

is both an example of writing tests and a self test for the SUnit. The tests here are pretty strange, since you want to make sure things blow up. You should not generally have to write tests this complicated in structure, although they will be far more complicated in terms of your own objects- more assertions, more complicated setup.

I am designed to make it easy to execute groups of tests* obtain a more detailed log of the results UI Description ___________ My left-most pane lists all of the categories that contain test classes (i.e., subclasses of TestCase); when some of these categories are selected, the test classes that they contain appear in the pane to the right. Abstract classes are italicized, and the test class hierarchy is shown by indentation, so subclasses of ClassTestCase are indented more than subclasses of TestCase. The tests that did not pass (if any) are listed in the right-hand panes of the Test Runner; if you want to debug one, to see why it failed, just click on the name.##### Instance
